Jupyter Book is an open source project for building beautiful,
publication-quality books and documents from computational material.

Here are some of the features of Jupyter Book:

**[Publication-quality content with Markdown](file-types:markdown)** ‚úç
^^^
You can write in either Jupyter Markdown, or an extended flavor of Markdown with [publishing features](content/myst).
This includes support for rich syntax such as [citations and cross-references](content/citations), [math and equations](content/math), and [figures](content/figures).

---
**[Write with many kinds of source files](file-types:index)** üìÑ
^^^
You can write your content in [Markdown files](file-types:markdown), in [Jupyter Notebooks](file-types:notebooks), [MyST Markdown Notebooks](file-types:myst-notebooks), [reStructuredText](file-types:rst), or [any Jupytext format](file-types:custom).

---
**[Execute, cache, and insert computational content](content/execute)** üöÄ
^^^
Execute notebook cells, then [format and insert the latest outputs](content:code-outputs) into your book.
[Cache outputs to save time in re-building later](execute/cache).
Even [save notebook outputs and insert them into other pages](content:code-outputs:glue).

---
**[Add interactivity to content and outputs](interactive/launchbuttons)** ‚ú®
^^^
[Toggle cell visibility](interactive/hiding), include [interactive outputs](interactive/interactive) from Jupyter, and [connect with online services](interactive/launchbuttons) like Binder.

---
**[Build books and articles in many formats](start/build)** üéÅ
^^^
You can build multi-page books or single articles, and generate many kinds of outputs from them, such as [HTML websites](start/build) or [PDF outputs](advanced/pdf).

---
**[Build books with a simple command-line interface](reference/cli)** ‚å®
^^^
You can quickly generate your books with one command, like so: `jupyter-book build mybook/`

- **Tutorials** are step-by-step introductory guides to Jupyter Book.
- **Topic Guides** cover specific areas in more depth, and are organized as discrete "how-to" sections.
- **Reference** sections describe the API/syntax/etc of Jupyter Book in detail.
